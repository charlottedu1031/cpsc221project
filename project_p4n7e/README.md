# My Personal Project: A Dating E-Diary Application

The application enables users to keep track of the details of the people they have dated in the past or are now seeing, which is applicable to basically everyone. For example, it may include a rating as well other than some personal information. This e-diary might serve as an invaluable memoir.

A person added to the diary.

# Phase 4: Task 3
- If I had more time, I would introduce 2 innerclasses (MainListener and PromptListener) in MainPage class, becasue other than MainPage there is no other classes that uses them. By doing so, it would make the UML look neater, and also provide clearer information about the whole project just from the UML itself.
